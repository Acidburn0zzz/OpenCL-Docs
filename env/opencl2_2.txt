== OpenCL 2.2

An OpenCL 2.2 environment must accept SPIR-V 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 modules.

=== Full Profile

An OpenCL 2.2 Full Profile environment is guaranteed to support the following SPIR-V capabilities:

* *Address*
* *DeviceEnqueue*
* *Float16Buffer*
* *GenericPointer*
* *Groups*
* *Int64*
* *Int16*
* *Int8*
* *Kernel*
* *Linkage*
* *Pipes*
* *Vector16*
* *SubgroupDispatch*
* *PipeStorage*

The following capabilities may be optionally supported:

* *ImageBasic*, if +CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT+ is +CL_TRUE+
* *Float64*, if the device supports double precision floating-point

If *ImageBasic* is supported then the following capabilities must also be supported:

* *ImageReadWrite*
* *LiteralSampler*
* *Sampled1D*
* *Image1D*
* *SampledBuffer*
* *ImageBuffer* 

=== Embedded Profile

An OpenCL 2.2 Embedded Profile environment is guaranteed to support the following SPIR-V capabilities:

* *Address*
* *DeviceEnqueue*
* *Float16Buffer*
* *GenericPointer*
* *Groups*
* *Int16*
* *Int8*
* *Kernel*
* *Linkage*
* *Pipes*
* *Vector16*
* *SubgroupDispatch*
* *PipeStorage*

Furthermore, the following capabilities may optionally be supported:

* *ImageBasic*, if +CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT+ is +CL_TRUE+
* *Float64*, if the device supports double precision floating-point

If *ImageBasic* is supported then the following capabilities must also be supported:

* *ImageReadWrite*
* *LiteralSampler*
* *Sampled1D*
* *Image1D*
* *SampledBuffer*
* *ImageBuffer* 

=== Validation Rules

The following are a list of validation rules for SPIR-V modules executing in an OpenCL 2.2 environment:

_Scope_ for _Execution_ is generally limited to:

* *Workgroup*
* *Subgroup*

_Scope_ for _Memory_ is generally limited to:

* *CrossDevice*
* *Device*
* *Workgroup*
* *Invocation*

_Scope_ for _Execution_ for the *OpGroupAsyncCopy* and *OpGroupWaitEvents* instructions is specifically limited to:

* *Workgroup*
