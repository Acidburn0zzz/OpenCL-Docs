== OpenCL 1.2

An OpenCL 1.2 environment must accept SPIR-V 1.0 modules if it includes the optional extension +cl_khr_il_program+ in the host API +CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS+ or +CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS+ string.

=== Full Profile

An OpenCL 1.2 Full Profile environment is guaranteed to support the following SPIR-V capabilities:

* *Address*
* *Float16Buffer*
* *Groups*
* *Int64*
* *Int16*
* *Int8*
* *Kernel*
* *Linkage*
* *Vector16*

The following capabilities may be optionally supported:

* *ImageBasic*, if +CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT+ is +CL_TRUE+
* *Float64*, if the device supports double precision floating-point

If *ImageBasic* is supported then the following capabilities must also be supported:

* *LiteralSampler*
* *Sampled1D*
* *Image1D*
* *SampledBuffer*
* *ImageBuffer* 

=== Embedded Profile

An OpenCL 1.2 Embedded Profile environment is guaranteed to support the following SPIR-V capabilities:

* *Address*
* *Float16Buffer*
* *Groups*
* *Int16*
* *Int8*
* *Kernel*
* *Linkage*
* *Pipes*
* *Vector16*

The following capabilities may be optionally supported:

* *ImageBasic*, if +CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT+ is +CL_TRUE+
* *Float64*, if the device supports double precision floating-point

If *ImageBasic* is supported then the following capabilities must also be supported:

* *LiteralSampler*
* *Sampled1D*
* *Image1D*
* *SampledBuffer*
* *ImageBuffer* 

=== Validation Rules

The following are a list of validation rules for SPIR-V modules executing in an OpenCL 1.2 environment:

_Scope_ for _Execution_ is generally limited to:

* *Workgroup*

_Scope_ for _Memory_ is generally limited to:

* *CrossDevice*
* *Device*
* *Workgroup*
* *Invocation*

The following *Group Instructions* are not supported:

* *OpGroupAll*
* *OpGroupAny*
* *OpGroupBroadcast*
* *OpGroupIAdd*
* *OpGroupFAdd*
* *OpGroupFMin*
* *OpGroupUMin*
* *OpGroupSMin*
* *OpGroupFMax*
* *OpGroupUMax*
* *OpGroupSMax*

For the *Barrier Instructions* *OpControlBarrier* and *OpMemoryBarrier*, the _Scope_ for execution must be *Workgroup*, the _Scope_ for memory must be *Workgroup*, and the _Memory Semantics_ must be *SequentiallyConsistent*.

For the *Atomic Instructions*, the _Scope_ must be *Device*, and the _Memory Semantics_ must be *Relaxed*.
