== Introduction

*OpenCL* (Open Computing Language) is an open royalty-free standard for general purpose parallel programming across CPUs, GPUs and other processors, giving software developers portable and efficient access to the power of these heterogeneous processing platforms.

Parallel programs in OpenCL may be written in the OpenCL C source language, or may compiled from OpenCL C, OpenCL {cpp}, or other source languages into SPIR-V modules.  

All SPIR-V intermediate binary modules are consumed by environments, such as an API, a specific version of an API, or an implementation of an API.  The environment describes required support for some SPIR-V capabilities, additional semantics for some SPIR-V instructions, and additional validation rules a module must adhere to in order to be considered valid.

This document describes the environment for implementations of the OpenCL API.  It is written for compiler developers who are generating SPIR-V modules to be consumed by the OpenCL API, for implementors of the OpenCL API who are consuming SPIR-V modules, and by software developers who are using SPIR-V modules with the OpenCL API.
