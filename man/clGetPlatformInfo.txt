= clGetPlatformInfo(3)

== Name
clGetPlatformInfo - Query information about an OpenCL platform

== C Specification

Specific information about an OpenCL platform can be obtained with the function:

include::{api}/protos/clGetPlatformInfo.txt[]


== Parameters

  * _platform_ refers to the platform ID returned by *clGetPlatformIDs* or can
    be `NULL`.
    If _platform_ is `NULL`, the behavior is implementation-defined.
  * _param_name_ is an enumeration constant that identifies the platform
    information being queried.
    It can be one of the following values as specified in the
    link:{html_spec_relative}#platform-queries-table[Platform Queries] table.
  * _param_value_ is a pointer to memory location where appropriate values for a
    given _param_name_, as specified in the link:{html_spec_relative}#platform-queries-table[Platform
    Queries] table, will be returned.
    If _param_value_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.
  * _param_value_size_ specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by
    _param_value_.
    This size in bytes must be {geq} size of return type specified in the
    link:{html_spec_relative}#platform-queries-table[Platform Queries] table.
  * _param_value_size_ret_ returns the actual size in bytes of data being
    queried by _param_name_.
    If _param_value_size_ret_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.


== Description

The information that can be queried using *clGetPlatformInfo* is specified
in the link:{html_spec_relative}#platform-queries-table[Platform Queries] table.

|====
| *cl_platform_info* | Return Type | Description
| *CL_PLATFORM_PROFILE*
  | char[]^1^
      | OpenCL profile string.
        Returns the profile name supported by the implementation.
        The profile name returned can be one of the following strings:

        FULL_PROFILE - if the implementation supports the OpenCL
        specification (functionality defined as part of the core
        specification and does not require any extensions to be supported).

        EMBEDDED_PROFILE - if the implementation supports the OpenCL
        embedded profile.
        The embedded profile is defined to be a subset for each version of
        OpenCL.
        The embedded profile for OpenCL 2.2 is described in
        link:{html_spec_relative}#opencl-embedded-profile[OpenCL Embedded Profile].
| *CL_PLATFORM_VERSION*
  | char[]
      | OpenCL version string.
        Returns the OpenCL version supported by the implementation.
        This version string has the following format:

        _OpenCL<space><major_version.minor_version><space><platform-specific
        information>_

        The _major_version.minor_version_ value returned will be 2.2.
| *CL_PLATFORM_NAME*
  | char[]
      | Platform name string.
| *CL_PLATFORM_VENDOR*
  | char[]
      | Platform vendor string.
| *CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS*
  | char[]
      | Returns a space separated list of extension names (the extension
        names themselves do not contain any spaces) supported by the
        platform.
        Each extension that is supported by all devices associated with this
        platform must be reported here.
| *CL_PLATFORM_HOST_TIMER_RESOLUTION*
  | cl_ulong
      | Returns the resolution of the host timer in nanoseconds as used by
        *clGetDeviceAndHostTimer*.
|====

*clGetPlatformInfo* returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors^2^.

  * CL_INVALID_PLATFORM if _platform_ is not a valid platform.
  * CL_INVALID_VALUE if _param_name_ is not one of the supported values or
    if size in bytes specified by _param_value_size_ is < size of return
    type as specified in the link:{html_spec_relative}#platform-queries-table[OpenCL Platform
    Queries] table, and _param_value_ is not a `NULL` value.
  * CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.


1::
    A null terminated string is returned by OpenCL query function calls if
    the return type of the information being queried is a char[].


2::
    The OpenCL specification does not describe the order of precedence for
    error codes returned by API calls.
