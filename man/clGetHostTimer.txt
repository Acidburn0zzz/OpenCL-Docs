= clGetHostTimer(3)

== Name
clGetHostTimer - Query the host clock

== C Specification

To query the host clock, call the function:

include::{api}/protos/clGetHostTimer.txt[]


== Parameters

_device_ is a device returned by *clGetDeviceIDs*.

_host_timestamp_ will be updated with the value of the current timer in
nanoseconds.
The resolution of the timer may be queried via *clGetPlatformInfo* and the
flag CL_PLATFORM_HOST_TIMER_RESOLUTION.


== Description

// refBody

*clGetHostTimer* returns the current value of the host clock as seen by
_device_.
This value is in the same timebase as the _host_timestamp_ returned from
*clGetDeviceAndHostTimer*.
The implementation will return with as low a latency as possible to allow a
correlation with a subsequent application sampled time.
The host timestamp and device timestamp returned by this function and
*clGetDeviceAndHostTimer* each have an implementation defined timebase.
The timestamps will always be in their respective timebases regardless of
which query function is used.
The timestamp returned from *clGetEventProfilingInfo* for an event on a
device and a device timestamp queried from the same device will always be in
the same timebase.

*clGetHostTimer* will return CL_SUCCESS with a time value in
_host_timestamp_ if provided.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * CL_INVALID_DEVICE if _device_ is not a valid OpenCL device.
  * CL_INVALID_VALUE if _host_timestamp_ is `NULL`.
  * CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
