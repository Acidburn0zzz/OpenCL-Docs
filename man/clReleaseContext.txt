= clReleaseContext(3)

== Name
clReleaseContext - Release an OpenCL context

== C Specification

To release a context, call the function:

include::{api}/protos/clReleaseContext.txt[]


== Parameters

_context_ specifies the OpenCL context to release.


== Description

// refBody

*clReleaseContext* decrements the _context_ reference count.
After the reference count becomes zero and all the objects attached to
_context_ (such as memory objects, command-queues) are released, the
_context_ is deleted.
Using this function to release a reference that was not obtained by creating
the object or by calling *clRetainContext* causes undefined behavior.

*clReleaseContext* returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * CL_INVALID_CONTEXT if _context_ is not a valid OpenCL context.
  * CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
