= clGetPlatformIDs(3)

== Name
clGetPlatformIDs - Query list of available platforms

== C Specification

The list of platforms available can be obtained with the function:

include::{api}/protos/clGetPlatformIDs.txt[]


== Parameters

_num_entries_ is the number of cl_platform_id entries that can be added to
_platforms_.
If _platforms_ is not `NULL`, the _num_entries_ must be greater than zero.

_platforms_ returns a list of OpenCL platforms found.
The cl_platform_id values returned in _platforms_ can be used to identify a
specific OpenCL platform.
If _platforms_ argument is `NULL`, this argument is ignored.
The number of OpenCL platforms returned is the minimum of the value
specified by _num_entries_ or the number of OpenCL platforms available.

_num_platforms_ returns the number of OpenCL platforms available.
If _num_platforms_ is `NULL`, this argument is ignored.


== Description

// refBody

*clGetPlatformIDs* returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * CL_INVALID_VALUE if _num_entries_ is equal to zero and _platforms_ is
    not `NULL` or if both _num_platforms_ and _platforms_ are `NULL`.
  * CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
