= clRetainDevice(3)

== Name
clRetainDevice - Retain an OpenCL device

== C Specification

To retain a device, call the function:

include::{api}/protos/clRetainDevice.txt[]


== Parameters

_device_ is the OpenCL device to retain.


== Description

// refBody

*clRetainDevice* increments the _device_ reference count if _device_ is a
valid sub-device created by a call to *clCreateSubDevices*.
If _device_ is a root level device i.e. a cl_device_id returned by
*clGetDeviceIDs*, the _device_ reference count remains unchanged.

*clRetainDevice* returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed successfully
or the device is a root-level device.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * CL_INVALID_DEVICE if _device_ is not a valid sub-device created by a
    call to *clCreateSubDevices*.
  * CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
