[[cl_khr_subgroup_named_barrier]]
== Named Barriers for Subgroups

This section describes the *cl_khr_subgroup_named_barrier* extension. This extension adds barrier operations that cover subsets of an OpenCL work-group.  Only the OpenCL API changes are described in this section.  Please refer to the SPIR-V specification for information about using subgroups named barriers in the SPIR-V intermediate representation, and to the OpenCL {cpp} specification for descriptions of the subgroup named barrier built-in functions in the OpenCL {cpp} kernel language.
